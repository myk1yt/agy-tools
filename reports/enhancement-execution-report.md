# Antigravity Reviewer Ecosystem Enhancement Execution Report

**Execution Status**: **SUCCESS**  
**Date**: 2026-10-07  
**Scope**: Code Reviewer & Security Reviewer Ecosystem Upgrade from Kimi Settings (`D:\OneDrive\Projects\kimi-settings` $\to$ `D:\OneDrive\Projects\Antigravity-cli`)  
**Deployment Target**: `C:\Users\k1yt\.gemini\config`  
**Test Suite Status**: 251 passed / 0 failed (100% pass rate)

## 1. Executive Summary

Antigravity's Code Reviewer and Security Reviewer subagent swarms and skills have been successfully upgraded to integrate the advanced threat-modeling, business logic abuse detection, multi-step attack chaining, anti-bikeshedding invariants, public contract blast-radius scanning, intent conformance verification, and scope guard capabilities from the renewed Kimi reviewers in `kimi-settings`.

All modifications strictly uphold:
1. **Zero Bloatware / Zero Dependencies**: Pure Node.js and standard Markdown specifications.
2. **English-Only Markdown Structures**: Pristine documentation and agent prompts.
3. **Hardware Read-Only Tool Invariants**: Subagents and agents remain strictly read-only (`view_file`, `list_dir`, `grep_search`, `find_by_name`, `run_command`, `invoke_subagent`, `send_message`), with zero file-mutating tools added.
4. **Idempotent Deployment**: Synced directly to `~/.gemini/config` via `scripts/lib/configure-customizations.js`.
5. **Full Test Integrity**: 251/251 test cases passing across all suites.

## 2. Inventory of Modified & Ported Files

### 2.1 Code Reviewer Ecosystem
| File Path | Change Type | Summary of Enhancements |
|---|---|---|
| `plugins/code_reviewer/agents/code-reviewer/agent.md` | Modified | Injected Diff Scope Guard (≤50 files / ≤2000 lines), Intent Conformance Checklist (missing requirements $\to$ P1), Public Contract Blast Radius Scan (`grep_search` across callers), Anti-Bikeshedding Invariant, and backward compatibility in `data-integrity`. |
| `plugins/code_reviewer/skills/code-review-taxonomy/SKILL.md` | Modified | Injected Semantic Failure Rule 13 (Anti-Bikeshedding), Diff Scope Guard, Intent Conformance, backward compatibility (breaking API shapes & rollback-unsafe DB migrations), and Public Contract Blast Radius scan in Step 3. |
| `skills/code-review-taxonomy/SKILL.md` | Modified | Root skill synchronized with plugin taxonomy with identical Rule 13, contract blast-radius scan, and backward compatibility invariants. |

### 2.2 Security Reviewer Ecosystem
| File Path | Change Type | Summary of Enhancements |
|---|---|---|
| `plugins/security_reviewer/agents/security-reviewer/agent.md` | Modified | Injected Threat Model Brief (Assets, Trust Boundaries, Entry Points, Attacker Tiers), Attack-Chain Analysis with escalation to 🔴 CRITICAL `A04:2021 - Insecure Design (chain)`, Conditional Dispatch for `sec-cloud-iam` (IaC/container files only), and unified finding schema with `Attacker Tier` & `Detection Telemetry`. |
| `plugins/security_reviewer/agents/sec-app-vuln/agent.md` | Modified | Added Business Logic Abuse checks (TOCTOU/Race conditions CWE-362, workflow bypass, mass assignment CWE-915, idempotency/replay/tampering, multi-tenant ORM/RAG isolation), Indirect Prompt Injection, Confused Deputy flows, and unified finding schema with `Attacker Tier` & `Detection Telemetry`. |
| `plugins/security_reviewer/agents/sec-cloud-iam/agent.md` | Modified | Updated finding schema to require `Attacker Tier` and `Detection Telemetry` (`detectable: <signal>` vs `no detection: <gap>`). |
| `plugins/security_reviewer/agents/sec-supply-mcp/agent.md` | Modified | Updated finding schema to require `Attacker Tier` and `Detection Telemetry`. |
| `plugins/security_reviewer/agents/sec-credential-scanner/agent.md` | Modified | Harmonized finding schema to require `Attacker Tier` and `Detection Telemetry` for complete swarm consistency. |

### 2.3 New Ported Skills
| File Path | Change Type | Summary of Enhancements |
|---|---|---|
| `skills/security-review-orchestrator/SKILL.md` | Ported (New) | Complete 36-section multi-pass security review orchestrator skill ported from `kimi-settings/skills/security-review-orchestrator/SKILL.md`. |
| `plugins/security_reviewer/skills/security-review-orchestrator/SKILL.md` | Ported (New) | Packaged into `plugins/security_reviewer/skills` for plugin-level distribution. |

## 3. Detailed Architectural Enhancements

### 3.1 Code Reviewer Enhancements
- **Failure Rule 13 (Anti-Bikeshedding Invariant)**: Reviewers are forbidden from reporting style, formatting, or naming nits already caught by Stage 0 linters/formatters or personal-preference refactors that match existing codebase conventions. The entire review budget is dedicated to semantic correctness, stability, and security.
- **Diff Scope Guard**: Diffs exceeding one rigorous pass (> 50 files or > 2000 lines) trigger an explicit recommendation to split the PR / diff scope rather than conducting a superficial or degraded review.
- **Intent Conformance**: Requirements from the delegation payload are systematically enumerated. Omissions or missing logic are classified as P1 Correctness defects ("absent logic outranks wrong logic").
- **Public Contract Blast Radius Scan**: When exported signatures, interfaces, schemas, database models, or config keys are modified, a mandatory repository-wide `grep_search` is performed to ensure every caller and consumer remains valid.
- **Backward Compatibility in Data Integrity**: Category 4 (`data-integrity`) now explicitly audits public API response shape changes and rollback-unsafe database migrations.

### 3.2 Security Reviewer & Domain Subagent Enhancements
- **Threat Model Brief**: Upfront synthesis (max 6 lines) mapping:
  1. *Assets*: Credentials, PII, financial flows, system control planes.
  2. *Trust Boundaries*: Internet $\to$ App, Client $\to$ Server, Low $\to$ High Privilege, Tenant $\to$ Tenant.
  3. *Entry Points*: Public endpoints, webhooks, file uploads, deep links, MCP tools, CI workflows.
  4. *Attacker Tiers*: Anonymous external, Authenticated user, Insider / compromised account, Supply chain.
- **Attack-Chain Analysis & Composite Escalation**: Reviews trace end-to-end multi-step paths across trust boundaries. When a combination of individually Medium or Low flaws achieves Critical impact (e.g., account takeover, unauthorized state mutation, secret leakage, or bulk exfiltration), the entire chain is escalated to 🔴 **CRITICAL** under category `A04:2021 - Insecure Design (chain)`.
- **Conditional Dispatch**: To optimize token efficiency and eliminate irrelevant noise, `sec-cloud-iam` is disabled by default and only dispatched when the review scope contains cloud/IaC artifacts (`*.tf`, `Dockerfile`, `*.k8s.yaml`, `docker-compose*.yml`, etc.).
- **Business Logic Abuse & Agentic Threats**:
  - TOCTOU / Race conditions (CWE-362)
  - Workflow state bypass & state machine omissions
  - Mass assignment (CWE-915)
  - Idempotency, replay, and quantity/price tampering
  - Multi-tenant ORM isolation & RAG vector metadata filtering
  - Indirect prompt injection & Confused Deputy tool execution flows
- **Unified Finding Schema**: All subagents now emit findings with `Attacker Tier` (weakest tier required to exploit) and `Detection Telemetry` (`detectable: <signal>` vs `no detection: <gap>`).

## 5. Conclusion

The Antigravity Reviewer ecosystem now possesses 1:1 parity with Kimi's advanced threat-modeling, attack-chaining, and review-discipline frameworks while adhering strictly to Google Antigravity's zero-dependency, hardware read-only safety invariants.
