## 🌟 Executive Overview

**Antigravity Developer Toolkit (`agy-tools`)** is a high-precision, zero-dependency CLI and dashboard suite designed specifically for **Antigravity CLI**. Its flagship command **`agy-tokens`** (also aliased as `agy-tools` and `agy-dashboard`) delivers instant statusline analytics, live 1:1 rate limit quota tracking, and an interactive real-time web dashboard.

### Why `agy-tools`?
- **Zero Antigravity Code Modifications**: A single `statusLine` command entry in `~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/settings.json` is the **ONLY** integration point needed.
- **1:1 Gemini Quota Pool Tracking**: Connects directly to the local Language Server via HTTPS/HTTP RPC to display exact **5-Hour (5h)** and **7-Day (7d)** rolling quota buckets with live countdown timers.
- **Real-Time SSE Web Dashboard**: Opens an interactive single-page dashboard on `http://127.0.0.1:8787` powered by Server-Sent Events (SSE) and responsive pure-SVG vector charts.
- **2026 Flagship Model Support**: Full out-of-the-box attribution for **Gemini 3.7 Flash**, **Gemini 3.6 Flash**, **Gemini 3.5 Flash**, **Claude Opus 4.6**, **Claude Sonnet 4.6**, and more.
- **Zero External Dependencies**: Engineered with pure Node.js standard libraries (`http`, `fs`, `path`, `net`, `child_process`) for sub-millisecond execution and instant startup.
- **Full Internationalization (i18n)**: 21 languages with automatic system locale detection and bidirectional RTL support (Arabic, Hebrew).

> [!TIP]
> Each row is a **complete, one-shot command for a fresh machine**: `git clone -b <branch>` checks the branch out *during* the clone, so there is no manual `git checkout` step left to forget (the classic "plugin.json not found" trap). The clone+checkout+installer chain is plain `&&`, which works in Command Prompt, bash (macOS/Linux) and PowerShell 7+. In the default **Windows PowerShell 5.1**, `&&` is not a valid separator — that is why every row also ships a `cmd /c "..."` wrapped version: paste *that one line* into a PowerShell window and it still runs end to end.

#### Install the prerequisites first (git + Node.js) — also one shot

`git` ships with Visual Studio Code and most developer setups; if it is genuinely missing, install it with `winget install --id Git.Git -e --accept-source-agreements --accept-package-agreements` first. Node.js is required **only for `main`** (the `Agent/*` plugin branches call `agy`, not `node`), and is a one-liner per platform:

```powershell
# Windows — install Node.js LTS (skip if `node --version` already works)
winget install --id OpenJS.NodeJS.LTS -e --accept-source-agreements --accept-package-agreements
```

```bash
# macOS (Homebrew)
brew install node

# Debian / Ubuntu
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y nodejs npm
```

After installing via winget, **open a brand-new terminal window** before running the install one-liner — a fresh window re-reads PATH so `node` becomes visible.

## 🧭 Beginner Guide: Installing Any Branch (No Command-Line Experience Needed)

This section is for first-time users. Follow it top to bottom and you will get any of the 4 installable branches (including `main`) working — no prior git or terminal knowledge required.

### Why `git clone -b <branch>` instead of `git checkout`?

This repository keeps each add-on in a **separate git branch** (like a separate room in the same house). A plain `git clone` only unpacks ONE room at a time, so running an installer afterwards without switching reports "plugin.json not found" — the files simply are not in your folder yet. The one-shot commands in the table above solve this for a fresh machine: `git clone -b <branch>` **checks the branch out during the clone itself**, so there is no separate `git checkout` step left to forget. (Use `git checkout <branch>` only when you already cloned the repo earlier and want to switch rooms in the same folder.)

### Step-by-step (Windows, no terminal experience required)

1. **Open a terminal in any folder** (it does not matter where — the command creates its own `agy-tools` folder)
   - Press **Win + R**, type `powershell`, press Enter. (Or use Command Prompt — both work, see step 2.)

2. **Paste ONE line for the branch you want** — the branch checkout is already built into the command:
   - **In PowerShell (the blue window):** paste the **`cmd /c "..."` column** version from the branch table above. PowerShell 5.1 does not understand bare `&&`, so the `cmd /c` wrapper is what makes a single paste work.
   - **In Command Prompt:** paste the **Command Prompt column** version.
   - What each one-shot line does, in order: ① clones the repo **already switched to the right branch** (`git clone -b <branch>`) → ② `cd agy-tools` → ③ runs that branch's installer. Example (designer, PowerShell):
   ```powershell
   cmd /c "git clone -b Agent/designer https://github.com/myk1yt/agy-tools.git && cd agy-tools && powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\install-designer.ps1"
   ```

3. **Verify it worked**
   - Any of the above installers ends with a list of active agents. You should see your new agent name there (e.g. `designer` or `security-reviewer`).
   - Or run this anytime:
   ```powershell
   agy agents
   ```

4. **Real usage examples (what you actually do with it)**
   - **Designer**: In the Antigravity chat input type `@designer` and then your request, for example:
     - `@designer draw a 680px SVG architecture diagram of a 3-tier web app`
     - `@designer build an interactive HTML widget with a slider that changes a 3D torus rotation speed`
   - **Security Reviewer**: In the Antigravity chat input type `@security-reviewer` plus the code/folder you want audited, for example:
     - `@security-reviewer audit this repository for hard-coded API keys and OWASP issues`
     - `@security-reviewer check the IAM roles in deploy/terraform/ for least privilege violations`
   - **gemini-config**: Nothing to type — after installing, Antigravity automatically loads the governance rules and orchestrator governance modules; the statusline badge (via the `statusLine` in settings.json) shows live token analytics every turn.

5. **Uninstall (when you no longer want it)**
   - Open a terminal inside the `agy-tools` folder created by the install (it is already on the right branch thanks to `git clone -b`), then:
   ```powershell
   # Designer
   powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/uninstall-designer.ps1
   # Security Reviewer
   powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/uninstall-security-reviewer.ps1
   # gemini-config
   scripts\uninstall.bat
   ```
   - Run `agy agents` afterwards: the agent name should be gone.

> Already cloned the repo before? You do not need to clone again — open a terminal inside the existing `agy-tools` folder, run `git checkout <branch>` (e.g. `git checkout Agent/designer`; the folder contents swap to that branch — nothing is deleted), and then run only the installer part of the one-liner.

### Frequent errors and the surest fix right now

| Symptom | Why it happens | Surest fix |
|---|---|---|
| PowerShell prints `<path>-File : 잘못된 인수` / `-File` value is cut short, e.g. only `...install-` then stops | The command was pasted from a webpage with a line break or smart quotes inside the path | Type the command by hand OR paste into Notepad first, fix broken lines/quotes, then run. Avoid quotes containing pasted spaces at the end |
| Endless repeated yellow/red `TLS ... handshake` / network flood in the terminal right after install | The statusline quota probe hammers the local Language Server when Antigravity is not running (pre-fix builds) | Update to the newest `main` (it contains a TLS probe cooldown guard), or run `scripts\uninstall.bat` on `main` to remove the statusline hook |
| `agy` is not recognized | The Antigravity CLI is not installed, or PATH does not include it | Install Antigravity CLI first; reopen the PowerShell window (a fresh window re-reads PATH) |
| `plugin.json not found` when running an installer | You cloned without `-b` and ran the installer on the wrong branch | Re-run the full one-shot line from the branch table (it clones with `-b <branch>`), or `git checkout <branch>` inside the existing `agy-tools` folder first, then run the installer again |
| PowerShell says script execution is disabled | Windows default policy blocks .ps1 files | Always launch through: `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\...ps1` exactly as written in this README |

> Each branch also has its own `README.md` with details specific to that branch (open it after checking out that branch).

```

---

## 📦 Quick Start & Installation

Prerequisites: **Node.js 16+** ([nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org)) and **Antigravity CLI**

### 1️⃣ One-Click Installation (Recommended)

Run ONE line in your terminal (pick the column matching your shell below). This registers global commands **AND automatically configures the statusline (`statusLine`) hook in `settings.json`**:

**Windows — Command Prompt:**
```cmd
git clone https://github.com/myk1yt/agy-tools.git && cd agy-tools && scripts\install.bat
```

**Windows — PowerShell (5.1 does not accept bare `&&`, hence the `cmd /c` wrapper):**
```powershell
cmd /c "git clone https://github.com/myk1yt/agy-tools.git && cd agy-tools && scripts\install.bat"
```

**Linux / macOS:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/myk1yt/agy-tools.git && cd agy-tools && bash scripts/install.sh
```

The installer registers the global commands via `npm link`, so no separate `npm install -g .` step is needed on a fresh machine (see section 3️⃣ below for later updates).

### 2️⃣ Getting Started
1. **Restart Antigravity CLI (`agy`)**.
2. Your terminal statusline will immediately display real-time token metrics and live Gemini quota pools!
3. To open the real-time browser dashboard, click `📊 Dashboard` in your terminal statusline or run:
```bash
agy-tokens --html --open
```

### 3️⃣ Updating your npm global copy (important: runtime uses the global copy)

The statusline and `agy-tokens` commands run from the **npm global installation**, not directly from this cloned folder. After you `git pull` (or switch branches and re-run the installer), refresh the global copy so the runtime matches the repo:

**Install fresh globally from this repo (Windows):**
```cmd
cd agy-tools
npm install -g .
```

**Update later (after `git pull`):** run the same `npm install -g .` again — this re-links the newest source into `C:\Users\<you>\AppData\Roaming\npm\node_modules\agy-tools\`.

Verify which copy actually runs and where it lives:
```cmd
agy-tokens --version
where agy-tokens
```
If the `where` output does not point at `AppData\Roaming\npm`, the old copy is shadowing the new one: close and reopen the terminal (PATH refresh) and rerun `npm install -g .`.

---

## ⚡ Statusline Integration & Architecture

`agy-tokens` operates as a statusline-powered real-time token monitor. **No modification of Antigravity core files is required.**

The installer script (`install.bat` / `install.sh`) automatically and safely merges the `statusLine` configuration into `~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/settings.json` (preserving your existing settings and creating automatic backups).

### Clean Statusline Format
The statusline badge renders without redundant prefixes, keeping terminal output clean, dense, and informative:

**English Statusline:**
```text
⚡ Turn: 1.2k ($0.0002) | Today: 45.8k ($0.0068) | Cache: 82% | 5h: ▰▰▰▰▱ 79% (4h 10m) | 7d: ▰▱▱▱▱ 21% (3d 20h) | 📊 Dashboard
```

**Korean Statusline:**
```text
⚡ 이번 턴: 1.2k (₩0.3) | 오늘 누적: 45.8k (₩9.9) | 캐시: 82% | 5h: ▰▰▰▰▱ 79% (4h 10m) | 7d: ▰▱▱▱▱ 21% (3d 20h) | 📊 대시보드
```

- `--hook`: Formats output for Antigravity's `PostInvocation` statusline runner.
- `--raw`: Strips JSON wrapper for direct terminal statusline display.
- `--write-dashboard`: Atomically synchronizes real-time dashboard data on every turn.

### 🔧 Manual Setup & Troubleshooting

If you prefer manual configuration or operate in specialized container/PATH environments:

#### Manual `settings.json` Configuration
Add the `statusLine` hook to `~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/settings.json`:
```json
{
  "statusLine": {
    "type": "command",
    "command": "agy-tokens --hook --raw --write-dashboard",
    "enabled": true,
    "stack_with_default": true
  }
}
```

- **Direct Node path**: `"command": "node /path/to/agy-tools/bin/agy-tokens.js --hook --raw --write-dashboard"`
- **Windows 8.3 short paths (if PATH is not inherited by subprocesses)**:
  `"command": "C:\\PROGRA~1\\nodejs\\node.exe %APPDATA%\\npm\\NODE_M~1\\AGY-TO~1\\bin\\AGY-TO~1.JS --hook --raw --write-dashboard"` (ensure backslashes are escaped as `\\`)

| `o1` | **o1** | OpenAI | 200k | $15.00 | $7.50 | $60.00 |

### Dynamic Pricing Sync Engine
Keep your pricing catalog synchronized with official API price updates:
```bash
# Display full official pricing catalog table
agy-tokens --prices --currency krw

# Synchronize latest pricing catalog from remote repository
agy-tokens --sync-prices

# Automatically check and sync pricing if older than 24 hours
agy-tokens --auto-sync
```

### Smart Fuzzy Heuristic Fallback
If custom or newly released models are detected in your session logs, `agy-tools` applies intelligent regex heuristics (`flash`, `pro`, `mini`, `free`, `local`) to assign appropriate rate tiers automatically.

---

## 📊 Real-Time SSE Web Dashboard

The web dashboard is an offline-capable, real-time analytics suite accessible from any web browser:

```bash
# Start local SSE server and open dashboard in browser
agy-tokens --serve --open

# Generate static HTML report and open immediately
agy-tokens --html --open
```

### Highlights
- **Dual Transport Protocol**: Operates via Server-Sent Events (`/events`) on `http://127.0.0.1:8787` or via script-tag polling on `file://` local pages without CORS errors.
- **Dynamic Pure-SVG Charts**: 30-day token volume visualizer with stacked bars (Input, Cached, Output), interactive tooltips, and dynamic Y-axis scaling.
- **Turn-by-Turn Model Attribution**: Full visibility into reasoning effort, multi-model sessions, and tool executions.
- **Interactive Filtering**: Real-time filtering by date range (Today, 7d, 30d, Custom Range) and AI model.
- **VS Code Terminal OSC 8 Integration**: Clicking the `📊 Dashboard` badge inside VS Code terminal automatically starts the background server and opens the browser.

## ⏱ 1:1 Gemini Quota Pool Integration

`agy-tools` directly queries the **Antigravity Language Server** via HTTPS/HTTP RPC (`RetrieveUserQuotaSummary`) to extract authentic rate limit metrics:

- **5-Hour Limit (`5h`)**: Short-term sliding window burst quota.
- **7-Day Limit (`7d`)**: Weekly sliding window cumulative allowance.
- **Live Countdown Timers**: Real-time remaining duration formatting (e.g. `4h 10m`, `3d 20h`).
- **30-Second Atomic Cache**: Cached at `~/.gemini/gemini_quota_cache.json` for sub-millisecond statusline reading with non-blocking background refreshes.

```bash
# Synchronize and inspect live Gemini quota pool
agy-tokens --sync-quota
```
