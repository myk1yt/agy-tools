## 🌟 Executive Overview

**Antigravity Developer Toolkit (`agy-tools`)** is a high-precision, zero-dependency CLI and dashboard suite designed specifically for **Antigravity CLI**. Its flagship command **`agy-tokens`** (also aliased as `agy-tools` and `agy-dashboard`) delivers instant statusline analytics, live 1:1 rate limit quota tracking, and an interactive real-time web dashboard.

### Why `agy-tools`?
- **Zero Antigravity Code Modifications**: A single `statusLine` command entry in `~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/settings.json` is the **ONLY** integration point needed.
- **1:1 Gemini Quota Pool Tracking**: Connects directly to the local Language Server via HTTPS/HTTP RPC to display exact **5-Hour (5h)** and **7-Day (7d)** rolling quota buckets with live countdown timers.
- **Real-Time SSE Web Dashboard**: Opens an interactive single-page dashboard on `http://127.0.0.1:8787` powered by Server-Sent Events (SSE) and responsive pure-SVG vector charts.
- **2026 Flagship Model Support**: Full out-of-the-box attribution for **Gemini 3.7 Flash**, **Gemini 3.6 Flash**, **Gemini 3.5 Flash**, **Claude Opus 4.6**, **Claude Sonnet 4.6**, and more.
- **Zero External Dependencies**: Engineered with pure Node.js standard libraries (`http`, `fs`, `path`, `net`, `child_process`) for sub-millisecond execution and instant startup.
- **Full Internationalization (i18n)**: 21 languages with automatic system locale detection and bidirectional RTL support (Arabic, Hebrew).

## 🧭 Beginner Guide: Installing Any Branch (No Command-Line Experience Needed)

This section is for first-time users. Follow it top to bottom and you will get any of the 4 non-main branches working — no prior git or terminal knowledge required.

### Why `git checkout` first?

This repository keeps each add-on in a **separate git branch** (like a separate room in the same house). The folder you downloaded contains files for ONE branch at a time. `git checkout <branch>` is the command that opens a specific room: **it swaps the visible files in your folder to that branch's files**, so the installer you run afterwards actually finds (for example) `plugins/designer/`. If you skip the checkout, the installer reports "plugin.json not found" because the files simply are not in your folder yet.

### Step-by-step (Windows, no terminal experience required)

1. **Open the branch switcher window**
   - In File Explorer, open the folder where you cloned/downloaded `agy-tools` (the folder that has `README.md` inside).
   - Hold **Shift** and **right-click an empty space** inside the folder → click **"Open PowerShell window here"** (or "여기에 PowerShell 창 열기" on a Korean Windows).
   - A blue/white PowerShell window opens with your folder already selected as its working directory.

2. **Look around (what you will see after each step)**
   - After step 1 you see the files of whatever branch is currently checked out.
   - After `git checkout Agent/designer`, the folder contents change to the designer branch: a new `plugins/designer/` folder appears and files from other branches disappear. That is normal — no files were deleted; switching branches just shows a different snapshot.

3. **Pick the branch you want and run its commands**
   - Type the branch checkout, press Enter, then run the branch's installer, press Enter:
   ```powershell
   # Designer (AI drawing/design agent)
   git checkout Agent/designer
   powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/install-designer.ps1

   # Security Reviewer (security audit agents)
   git checkout Agent/security-reviewer
   powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/install-security-reviewer.ps1

   # Governance config bundle (rules + skills + hooks, NOT a plugin)
   git checkout gemini-config
   scripts\install.bat
   ```
   - For `main` (the token tracker core) no checkout is needed if you just cloned — run `scripts\install.bat`.

4. **Verify it worked**
   - Any of the above installers ends with a list of active agents. You should see your new agent name there (e.g. `designer` or `security-reviewer`).
   - Or run this anytime:
   ```powershell
   agy agents
   ```

5. **Real usage examples (what you actually do with it)**
   - **Designer**: In the Antigravity chat input type `@designer` and then your request, for example:
     - `@designer draw a 680px SVG architecture diagram of a 3-tier web app`
     - `@designer build an interactive HTML widget with a slider that changes a 3D torus rotation speed`
   - **Security Reviewer**: In the Antigravity chat input type `@security-reviewer` plus the code/folder you want audited, for example:
     - `@security-reviewer audit this repository for hard-coded API keys and OWASP issues`
     - `@security-reviewer check the IAM roles in deploy/terraform/ for least privilege violations`
   - **gemini-config**: Nothing to type — after installing, Antigravity automatically loads the governance rules; `/usage` becomes available as a slash command to see token cost analytics.

6. **Uninstall (when you no longer want it)**
   - Stay in the SAME branch as the thing you installed (use `git checkout Agent/designer` again if needed), then:
   ```powershell
   # Designer
   powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/uninstall-designer.ps1
   # Security Reviewer
   powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/uninstall-security-reviewer.ps1
   # gemini-config
   scripts\uninstall.bat
   ```
   - Run `agy agents` afterwards: the agent name should be gone.

### Frequent errors and the surest fix right now

| Symptom | Why it happens | Surest fix |
|---|---|---|
| PowerShell prints `<path>-File : 잘못된 인수` / `-File` value is cut short, e.g. only `...install-` then stops | The command was pasted from a webpage with a line break or smart quotes inside the path | Type the command by hand OR paste into Notepad first, fix broken lines/quotes, then run. Avoid quotes containing pasted spaces at the end |
| Endless repeated yellow/red `TLS ... handshake` / network flood in the terminal right after install | The statusline quota probe hammers the local Language Server when Antigravity is not running (pre-fix builds) | Update to the newest `main` (it contains a TLS probe cooldown guard), or run `scripts\uninstall.bat` on `main` to remove the statusline hook |
| `agy` is not recognized | The Antigravity CLI is not installed, or PATH does not include it | Install Antigravity CLI first; reopen the PowerShell window (a fresh window re-reads PATH) |
| `plugin.json not found` when running an installer | You ran the installer before switching branches | Run `git checkout <branch>` FIRST (see step 3), confirm the branch's folder exists, then run the installer again |
| PowerShell says script execution is disabled | Windows default policy blocks .ps1 files | Always launch through: `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\...ps1` exactly as written in this README |

> Each branch also has its own `README.md` with details specific to that branch (open it after checking out that branch).

## 📦 Quick Start & Installation

Prerequisites: **Node.js 16+** ([nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org)) and **Antigravity CLI**

### 1️⃣ One-Click Installation (Recommended)

Run the following 3 commands in your terminal. This registers global commands **AND automatically configures the statusline (`statusLine`) hook in `settings.json`**:

**Windows (Command Prompt / PowerShell):**
```cmd
git clone https://github.com/myk1yt/agy-tools.git
cd agy-tools
scripts\install.bat
```

**Linux / macOS:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/myk1yt/agy-tools.git
cd agy-tools
chmod +x scripts/install.sh && ./scripts/install.sh
```

### 2️⃣ Getting Started
1. **Restart Antigravity CLI (`agy`)**.
2. Your terminal statusline will immediately display real-time token metrics and live Gemini quota pools!
3. To open the real-time browser dashboard, click `📊 Dashboard` in your terminal statusline or run:
```bash
agy-tokens --html --open
```

### 3️⃣ Updating your npm global copy (important: runtime uses the global copy)

The statusline and `agy-tokens` commands run from the **npm global installation**, not directly from this cloned folder. After you `git pull` (or switch branches and re-run the installer), refresh the global copy so the runtime matches the repo:

**Install fresh globally from this repo (Windows):**
```cmd
cd agy-tools
npm install -g .
```

**Update later (after `git pull`):** run the same `npm install -g .` again — this re-links the newest source into `C:\Users\<you>\AppData\Roaming\npm\node_modules\agy-tools\`.

Verify which copy actually runs and where it lives:
```cmd
agy-tokens --version
where agy-tokens
```
If the `where` output does not point at `AppData\Roaming\npm`, the old copy is shadowing the new one: close and reopen the terminal (PATH refresh) and rerun `npm install -g .`.

---

## ⚡ Statusline Integration & Architecture

`agy-tokens` operates as a statusline-powered real-time token monitor. **No modification of Antigravity core files is required.**

The installer script (`install.bat` / `install.sh`) automatically and safely merges the `statusLine` configuration into `~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/settings.json` (preserving your existing settings and creating automatic backups).

### Clean Statusline Format
The statusline badge renders without redundant prefixes, keeping terminal output clean, dense, and informative:

**English Statusline:**
```text
⚡ [Antigravity] Turn: 1.2k ($0.0002) | Today: 45.8k ($0.0068) | Cache: 82% | 5h: ▰▰▰▰▱ 79% (4h 10m) | 7d: ▰▱▱▱▱ 21% (3d 20h) | 📊 Dashboard
```

**Korean Statusline:**
```text
⚡ [Antigravity] 이번 턴: 1.2k (₩0.3) | 오늘 누적: 45.8k (₩9.9) | 캐시: 82% | 5h: ▰▰▰▰▱ 79% (4h 10m) | 7d: ▰▱▱▱▱ 21% (3d 20h) | 📊 대시보드
```

- `--hook`: Formats output for Antigravity's `PostInvocation` statusline runner.
- `--raw`: Strips JSON wrapper for direct terminal statusline display.
- `--write-dashboard`: Atomically synchronizes real-time dashboard data on every turn.

### 🔧 Manual Setup & Troubleshooting

If you prefer manual configuration or operate in specialized container/PATH environments:

#### Manual `settings.json` Configuration
Add the `statusLine` hook to `~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/settings.json`:
```json
{
  "statusLine": {
    "type": "command",
    "command": "agy-tokens --hook --raw --write-dashboard",
    "enabled": true,
    "stack_with_default": true
  }
}
```

- **Direct Node path**: `"command": "node /path/to/agy-tools/bin/agy-tokens.js --hook --raw --write-dashboard"`
- **Windows 8.3 short paths (if PATH is not inherited by subprocesses)**:
  `"command": "C:\\PROGRA~1\\nodejs\\node.exe %APPDATA%\\npm\\NODE_M~1\\AGY-TO~1\\bin\\AGY-TO~1.JS --hook --raw --write-dashboard"` (ensure backslashes are escaped as `\\`)

| `o1` | **o1** | OpenAI | 200k | $15.00 | $7.50 | $60.00 |

### Dynamic Pricing Sync Engine
Keep your pricing catalog synchronized with official API price updates:
```bash
# Display full official pricing catalog table
agy-tokens --prices --currency krw

# Synchronize latest pricing catalog from remote repository
agy-tokens --sync-prices

# Automatically check and sync pricing if older than 24 hours
agy-tokens --auto-sync
```

### Smart Fuzzy Heuristic Fallback
If custom or newly released models are detected in your session logs, `agy-tools` applies intelligent regex heuristics (`flash`, `pro`, `mini`, `free`, `local`) to assign appropriate rate tiers automatically.

## 📊 Real-Time SSE Web Dashboard

The web dashboard is an offline-capable, real-time analytics suite accessible from any web browser:

```bash
# Start local SSE server and open dashboard in browser
agy-tokens --serve --open

# Generate static HTML report and open immediately
agy-tokens --html --open
```

### Highlights
- **Dual Transport Protocol**: Operates via Server-Sent Events (`/events`) on `http://127.0.0.1:8787` or via script-tag polling on `file://` local pages without CORS errors.
- **Dynamic Pure-SVG Charts**: 30-day token volume visualizer with stacked bars (Input, Cached, Output), interactive tooltips, and dynamic Y-axis scaling.
- **Turn-by-Turn Model Attribution**: Full visibility into reasoning effort, multi-model sessions, and tool executions.
- **Interactive Filtering**: Real-time filtering by date range (Today, 7d, 30d, Custom Range) and AI model.

## ⏱ 1:1 Gemini Quota Pool Integration

`agy-tools` directly queries the **Antigravity Language Server** via HTTPS/HTTP RPC (`RetrieveUserQuotaSummary`) to extract authentic rate limit metrics:

- **5-Hour Limit (`5h`)**: Short-term sliding window burst quota.
- **7-Day Limit (`7d`)**: Weekly sliding window cumulative allowance.
- **Live Countdown Timers**: Real-time remaining duration formatting (e.g. `4h 10m`, `3d 20h`).
- **30-Second Atomic Cache**: Cached at `~/.gemini/gemini_quota_cache.json` for sub-millisecond statusline reading with non-blocking background refreshes.

```bash
# Synchronize and inspect live Gemini quota pool
agy-tokens --sync-quota
```

👉 **Read the complete technical specification in [docs/QUOTA_POOL.md](docs/QUOTA_POOL.md)**.

## 🌐 Internationalization (i18n) — 21 Languages

`agy-tools` automatically detects the host system locale (`LANG`, `LC_ALL`, etc.) and supports 21 languages out-of-the-box, with dedicated bidirectional Right-to-Left (RTL) formatting:

| Region | Supported Languages & Locale Codes |
| :--- | :--- |
| **East Asia** | English (`en`), 한국어 (`ko`), 日本語 (`ja`), 简体中文 (`zh`), 繁體中文 (`zh-TW`) |
| **South & Southeast Asia** | हिन्दी (`hi`), Tiếng Việt (`vi`), Bahasa Indonesia (`id`), ภาษาไทย (`th`) |
| **Europe** | Deutsch (`de`), Français (`fr`), Español (`es`), Português (`pt`), Italiano (`it`), Nederlands (`nl`), Polski (`pl`), Svenska (`sv`), Русский (`ru`), Türkçe (`tr`) |
| **Middle East (RTL)** | العربية (`ar`), עברית (`he`) |

```bash
# Force Korean language output
agy-tokens --7d --lang ko

# Force Japanese language output
agy-tokens --30d --lang ja

# Force Arabic (RTL) language output
agy-tokens --lang ar
```
