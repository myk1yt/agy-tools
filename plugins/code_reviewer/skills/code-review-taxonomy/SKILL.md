  8-category taxonomy scan for pre-merge diff review (code-reviewer Stage 1).
  Classifies findings as correctness/security/stability/data-integrity/performance/
  maintainability/test-coverage/style-docs with P0-P3 severity and 0-100 confidence.
  Security findings bypass the confidence filter and hand off to security-reviewer.

# Code Review Taxonomy

> Pre-merge semantic diff review. Trigger: code-reviewer Stage 1, after the Stage 0 quality-gate scan.

## 1. Purpose

This skill is Stage 1 of the code-reviewer 4-stage pipeline. It turns a raw diff into normalized, severity-rated findings the rest of the pipeline can filter and count. It prevents the 12 most common semantic-review failures:

1. **Duplicating Stage 0**: re-running build/lint/type/test checks the deterministic scan already covered.
2. **Context creep**: reviewing unchanged files and flooding output with pre-existing issues.
3. **Vague findings**: "this looks off" with no file, line, or evidence.
4. **Severity inflation**: marking style nits as blockers, hiding real P0 items.
5. **Severity deflation**: downgrading a P0 so the verdict reads PASS.
6. **Confidence guessing**: reporting numbers with no stated basis.
7. **One root cause, three findings**: duplicate records for the same defect.
8. **Fixing while reviewing**: applying edits instead of returning findings (audit-only role).
9. **Security tunnel vision**: either skipping security patterns or treating every security hit as a full security-reviewer cycle.
10. **Category drift**: labeling a data-loss bug as "style" because the diff touched formatting.
11. **Lockfile noise**: findings on vendored, generated, or lock files.
12. **Verdict shopping**: re-scanning with loosened rules until the count reads zero.

## 2. Scope & Boundaries

- **Read-only**: findings and recommendations only. Never edit, never commit. Fixes route back to developer or coding agents.
- **Changed files only**: findings attach to added/modified lines in the diff. Unchanged code is context, never a finding target.
- **Auto-skip**: vendored code, generated code, lockfiles, minified assets. List them under "Skipped" in the report, never review them.
- **Stage separation**: Stage 0 (quality-gate, scoped to QG-01/02/03/04/10/12/13 + QG-14) owns deterministic checks. This stage owns semantic judgment. Do not re-run builds, tests, lint, or formatters.
- **Pipeline position**: Stage 2 applies the confidence filter (keep ≥75, security bypasses) and Stage 3 handles learning handoff. This stage emits raw normalized findings; it does not filter, verdict, or hand off.

## 3. The 8 Categories

Every finding lands in exactly one category. Pick by defect, not by the file's dominant topic.

| # | Category | Scan focus |
|---|----------|-----------|
| 1 | correctness | Logic errors, off-by-one, inverted conditions, wrong operators, dead branches, broken invariants, API contract misuse, wrong return handling |
| 2 | security | Injection, broken authn/authz, secret exposure, unsafe deserialization, path traversal, SSRF, crypto misuse, missing input validation on trust boundaries |
| 3 | stability | Crash paths, unhandled errors/panics, race conditions, deadlocks, resource leaks, missing awaits, unhandled rejections, lifecycle misuse (init/build/dispose) |
| 4 | data-integrity | Validation gaps, transaction boundaries, migration safety, idempotency, partial-failure data loss, type/coercion mismatches at storage or API boundaries |
| 5 | performance | Superlinear complexity, N+1 queries, needless allocations/copies, blocking I/O on hot paths, unbounded growth, missing pagination |
| 6 | maintainability | Dead code, duplicated logic, oversized functions, leaky abstractions, names/structure that hide intent |
| 7 | test-coverage | Changed logic without tests, missing edge cases (empty/null/max/concurrency), assertions that cannot fail, mocks that mirror the implementation |
| 8 | style-docs | Formatting, naming-convention drift, comments/docs that no longer match the code, missing doc updates tied to the diff |

## 4. Severity (P0-P3)

| Emoji | Severity | Meaning | Merge effect |
|-------|----------|---------|--------------|
| 🔴 | P0 | Defect or exposure that must block merge: data loss, security hole, crash, broken core behavior | Verdict REJECT, zero tolerance |
| 🟠 | P1 | Real defect or high-risk gap, no safe default; fix before merge | Verdict CONDITIONAL at best |
| 🟡 | P2 | Should fix; explicit per-finding author waiver allowed | CONDITIONAL with waiver |
| 🟢 | P3 | Polish: style, docs, minor maintainability | Does not block |

Severity comes from impact, not from how easy the fix is. One hunk can hold several severities; record each separately.

## 5. Confidence (0-100)

Integer 0-100, assigned per finding with this rubric:

| Band | Label | Bar |
|------|-------|-----|
| 90-100 | Proven | Exact code path traced; provable from the diff plus surrounding source alone |
| 75-89 | Strong | Clear evidence in the diff; at most one stated assumption |
| 50-74 | Plausible | Pattern matches a known defect shape; key context not verified |
| 0-49 | Guess | Not reportable; convert into a question for the author |

Caps: max 89 without tracing the exact path. Reserve 95-100 for diff-alone proof. Stage 2 drops everything below 75 except the security category.

## 6. Security Handling (Bypass + Handoff)

- Any finding in the security category sets `handoff: security-reviewer`, regardless of confidence.
- Security findings are never dropped by the Stage 2 numeric filter.
- This stage does not run a full security review. It flags, rates severity, and hands off. `security-reviewer` owns the security verdict (conditional confirmation pass).
- Mark likely-false-positive security patterns as confidence ≤74 with `handoff: none`; record the reasoning so `security-reviewer` does not re-triage blind.

## 7. Scan Procedure

1. Load the diff: orchestrator payload or `git diff <base>...HEAD`. Enumerate changed files; auto-skip the §2 list.
2. For each remaining file, read the diff hunks plus surrounding context (about ±20 lines where needed).
3. Run all 8 category lenses over each hunk. Record every candidate as a finding record (§8).
4. Assign severity (§4) and confidence (§5) to each candidate.
5. Set `handoff` per §6 for security-category records.
6. Deduplicate: same root cause becomes one finding, keeping the highest severity; note merged IDs.
7. Order output P0 first, then P1, P2, P3; within a severity, by confidence descending.
8. Emit the Stage 1 report (§9). Stop. No fixes, no commits, no re-scans.

## 8. Finding Record Schema

```
[F-NN]
category: correctness | security | stability | data-integrity | performance | maintainability | test-coverage | style-docs
severity: P0 | P1 | P2 | P3 (with emoji)
confidence: 0-100
file: <path>
lines: L<start>-L<end>
title: <one line, defect + location implied>
evidence: <snippet or traced path; enough to verify without re-running the scan>
recommendation: <one line; direction only, no patch>
handoff: security-reviewer | none
```

A finding without `file`, `lines`, `evidence`, or `confidence` is incomplete. Reject it before it reaches the report.

## 9. Output (Stage 1 Report)

```markdown
## Stage 1 Taxonomy Scan Report
### Scope: <base>...<head>, N files, M hunks
### Findings: K total | P0: a | P1: b | P2: c | P3: d | security handoff: h
| ID | Sev | Category | Conf | File:Lines | Title |
|----|-----|----------|------|-------------|-------|
| F-01 | 🔴 P0 | correctness | 92 | src/x.ts:L40-L55 | ... |
### Finding Details
[F-01] ... (full record per §8)
### Skipped: <vendored/generated/lock files>
### Author Questions: <sub-75 confidence items converted to questions, security excluded>
```

The verdict (PASS / CONDITIONAL / REJECT) is computed by the `code-reviewer` agent from this report plus Stage 0 output, not by this skill.
